●	Background and Motivation
The Smart Medicine Box Dispenser with Reminders is designed to automate 
and simplify the medication management process. This innovative device not 
only stores medications securely but also dispenses the correct doses at the 
prescribed times. Through integrated reminders and notifications, the system 
ensures that users take their medication on time, every time.
●	Problem Statement
As people age or manage chronic health conditions, it becomes increasingly 
important to keep track of their medication schedules. Forgetting to take 
medications on time can result in serious health consequences. A smart 
medicine box dispenser is designed to solve this problem by automating the 
dispensing of medication and sending reminders to the user.
